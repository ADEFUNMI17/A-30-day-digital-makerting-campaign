# A-30-day-digital-makerting-campaign
Project Title:
Create and Present a 30-Day Digital Marketing Campaign from Scratch

Overview:
Over the past weeks, you’ve learnt the core elements of digital marketing, from understanding audiences to using analytics, content creation, and digital ads. 

Now it’s time to put that knowledge into action by developing a complete, practical marketing campaign for a product or service.

Each group will act like a marketing agency hired by a client. Your task is to create a 30-day campaign strategy that achieves a clear marketing goal. 

You’ll audit digital platforms, create content, write ad copy and emails, plan a simple funnel, and incorporate tools like SEO, GA4, and AI.
